# Copywork Lab

My Biggest problem was the font they used. I found out that they use the "Futura" font, however they use a special edition of it, which was going to cost $70 NZD to get. I did however find a free version of Futura, which had minor differences compared to the version they used.

I also had a lot of trouble getting the text to fit with the original text, even if the font was the same. So I ended up having to use the Character Window in photoshop, which allowed me to adjust the spacing, verging, etc, so that the text lined up with the original.

As for Images, I couldn't find the same images (excluding one of them, at the bottom of the page). So I used images that had a similar feel or look to them, and adjusted them in photoshop to make them look more like the images the original design used. The design of the page itself was changed to accommodate the top image (so that it was more faithful to the original).

While working on this, I realised how many changes in the design occurred over the page, where text spacing changed, font sizes varied, the alignment of images or shapes seemed to change a lot throughout the page, which made the copywork more difficult than I first thought.
