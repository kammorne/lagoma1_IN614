    <p><em>The camera shows a POV shot of the driver driving the car in everyday conditions around Dunedin.</em></p>

    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <p class="character">...And it comes with special-edition floor mats.</p>

    <p><em>The camera shows the boot of the car.</p></em>

    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <p class="character">The trunk space is reasonable for a family sized hatchback, with a storage size of 360 litres, allowing you to easily carry either your luggage or groceries with ease
    </p>
    <p><em>The front of the vehicle is shown from a low angle, panning along the front of the car.
    </em></p>
    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <p class="character">Now this model is a slight upgrade from the base 'GX' model, and everyone probably knows what the 'R' stands for...

    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <p class="character">Like a corolla could be fast anyway...
    </p>
    <p><em>The camera goes back to displaying the car at varying angles, showcasing it.
    </em></p>
    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>

    <p class="character">The 2016 Toyota Corolla is exactly what everyone expects it to be. Limited Edition run or not. It is, just a car. a 4-door family hatchback.

    <p><em>The camera cuts to a different segment of the highway, showing the car overtake the camera.
    </em></p>
    <h3 class="character">VOICEOVER</h3>
    <p class="character">So... This is just your average family car, a car you've probably seen all over New Zealand heaps of times, but it's my car, and it hasn't failed me yet.
